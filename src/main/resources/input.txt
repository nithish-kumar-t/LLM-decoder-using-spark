Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between towering mountains and dense forests, there lived a young boy named Leo. Leo was curious about the world beyond the village. Every day, he would gaze up at the mountains and wonder what lay on the other side.

One morning, after much planning and preparation, Leo decided to set off on an adventure. He packed a small bag with essentials—some bread, a flask of water, and a map his grandfather had given him. The map was old, faded, and covered in mysterious symbols, but Leo felt it held the key to a great journey.

As he climbed higher and higher, the village disappeared behind him, and the air grew thin and cool. The path was narrow and winding, surrounded by the sounds of rustling leaves and distant birdsong. After hours of walking, he reached a high ridge and saw a vast forest stretching as far as his eyes could see.

Leo continued on, determined to uncover the secrets of the forest. As he ventured deeper, he noticed strange carvings on trees and rocks, symbols similar to those on his grandfather’s map. He felt both a thrill of excitement and a slight chill of fear. The forest felt alive, watching him, as if it held stories of ancient travelers who had walked these paths long before him.

After a while, Leo found a clearing where the sun broke through the dense canopy, illuminating an ancient stone pedestal in the center. On the pedestal was a small, shimmering crystal, glowing with a soft blue light. Intrigued, he stepped forward and reached out to touch it. The moment his fingers brushed the crystal, he felt a surge of energy flow through him.

Suddenly, images flashed before his eyes—visions of distant lands, strange creatures, and powerful storms. He realized this was no ordinary crystal; it was a guide, showing him the path to wonders and dangers he had only dreamed of.

With renewed determination, Leo decided to follow the crystal's guidance. His journey was only beginning, and he felt ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. Little did he know, his adventure would lead him to places he never imagined, filled with magic, mystery, and wisdom beyond his years.

As night fell, Leo set up camp under the stars, feeling a deep sense of peace. He lay by the fire, looking up at the constellations, wondering how many more secrets the world had yet to reveal. The forest was silent, save for the crackling of the fire and the occasional rustle in the bushes. And as he drifted off to sleep, he dreamed of the adventures that awaited him, guided by the light of the mysterious crystal.

The Fortune Teller has come to see me several times since then.
Telling me a story or giving me a degraded potion.
She also gives me some food.
In the meantime, my situation is getting worse and worse.
About a year after that day, I could not enter my room.
Sad and crying, I threw the cup, which was on the desk, towards my mother.
After that, I was beaten many times by my father and experienced pain I had never felt before.
My mother never stopped my father.

Although it was a degraded version, the potion was helpful.
I was sad that my scars had increased, but there were no tears.
I was strangely relieved as I began to live hidden in the woods.
Since I didn't want to be seen by anyone, I developed a technique to hide myself.
I just honed that skill so that I could not be found.

Meanwhile, I read the book repeatedly to memorize it in my head.
Edible nuts, poison grass, medicinal herbs.
I learned to recognize each characteristic.
This will make life in the forest safer.
I remember I ate a poison by mistake and suffered.

I was worried about something, so I left the forest for the first time in a long time and went to the village.
They looked surprised, maybe because they thought I was dead.
I don't care. They thought I was dead.
What worries me is the Fortune Teller.
She visited me every two weeks, but I had just seen her about a month ago.
Did something happen?
There was no one in the Fortune Teller's house.
I'm worried about what happened.

I hear a voice whispering in the back.
When I listen carefully, I can hear what they're talking about.
The contents of the conversation make me feel as if I had my chest tightly grasped.
I leave and run away to the forest.
The Fortune Teller died.
I heard that she had a cold.
If there is a potion that the village chief has, she can be cured.
But…the village chief refused to treat her with the potions.
The cause is me.
The Fortune Teller who helped me earned the animosity of the village.
I didn't know that.
Because of me...

I return to my hiding place.
I need to do something.
Although I was sad, there was no tear for some reason.
I have 5 degraded versions of the magic bag.
Fold 1 of the bag in half and wrap it around the waist with a string.
The remaining 4 are put to the right and left, 2 on each side.
Pack as much as I can into each bag.

Many potions of degraded versions, including ones for healing wounds, curing diseases, suppressing pain, and breaking curses.
Because all of them are degraded versions, I only knew their effectiveness once I used them.
Unless it's the worst version, it should heal to some extent.
I knew it from my experience.
As I run through the forest, I collect everything hidden in preparation for the journey.
I don't want to leave anything I collect or hide with the Fortune Teller.
