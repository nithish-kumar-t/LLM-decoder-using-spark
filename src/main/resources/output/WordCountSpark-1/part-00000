FALSTAFF
Thou
hast
the
most
unsavoury
similes
and
art
indeed
the
most
comparative
rascalliest
sweet
young
prince
But
Hal
I
prithee
trouble
me
no
more
with
vanity
I
would
to
God
thou
and
I
knew
where
a
commodity
of
good
names
were
to
be
bought
An
old
lord
of
the
council
rated
me
the
other
day
in
the
street
about
you
sir
but
I
marked
him
not
and
yet
he
talked
very
wisely
but
I
regarded
him
not
and
yet
he
talked
wisely
and
in
the
street
too
PRINCE
HENRY
Thou
didst
well
for
wisdom
cries
out
in
the
streets
and
no
man
regards
it
FALSTAFF
O
thou
hast
damnable
iteration
and
art
indeed
able
to
corrupt
a
saint
Thou
hast
done
much
harm
upon
me
Hal
God
forgive
thee
for
it
Before
I
knew
thee
Hal
I
knew
nothing
and
now
am
I
if
a
man
should
speak
truly
little
better
than
one
of
the
wicked
I
must
give
over
this
life
and
I
will
give
it
over
by
the
Lord
and
I
do
not
I
am
a
villain
